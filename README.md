# KOALA
- This is a discord bot that is coded in python. I use it in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5b8pyv99j2), the code is open source as I wanna keep this as a hobby project. Feel free to pull any merge requests with commands that u think i should add in the bot. You can also use this script with your own **__private__** bots
- This bot has everything from custom media embeds (if you wanna block urls in your server, Koala bot uses the support of tenor moderation to post requests tenor gifs) and also has a command to embed github projects.
- Also includes a database system to store important stuff like user warnings and bot prefix. I have tried my best to made sure there are no injections or exploits that can be done with these commands. If you find some, make sure to open a pull request or reach out to me
- If you decide to host a public bot using my script, kindly mention the use of the code snippets that you might be taking from it.

Cheers :)

# MENTIONS
- Bug fix by [ItsVixty](https://github.com/ItzVixty), could be abused to ping everyone while searching at someone's github profile using the bot
- My community for recommending a recode with config and well structured files
